Description of the Graph: "Churn Status vs Engagement Rate"
This bar chart compares customer engagement levels for those who have churned ("Yes") and those who have not churned ("No"). The x-axis represents the churn status, while the y-axis represents the number of customers. Different colors represent different engagement rates.

Key Insights:
Similar Distribution: The engagement rate distribution is similar for both churned and non-churned customers.
Higher Engagement Does Not Prevent Churn: Even customers with higher engagement levels still churn, indicating that engagement alone does not ensure retention.
Balanced Proportions: Each engagement level has a similar count across both churned and retained customers.
Implications:
Content quality, pricing, or external factors may influence churn more than just engagement.
Additional factors like customer experience, payment flexibility, and service satisfaction need to be analyzed.

# Churn Status vs Payment History

# Churn Status vs Number of Subscribers

## Churn analysis revealed that 50.7% (1,778 users) have canceled their subscription, while 49.3% (1,728 users) have retained it. The high churn rate indicates a need for improved retention strategies. Personalized content, flexible pricing, and engagement initiatives can help reduce churn. Additionally, analyzing payment history may provide insights into whether delayed payments contribute to cancellations. These findings can assist Netflix in enhancing user experience and minimizing churn.

## What factors influence whether a customer churns or stays subscribed?
Engagement Rate: Higher engagement does not always prevent churn.
Number of Subscribers: Churn is not significantly affected by total subscribers.
Payment History: Customers with delayed payments are more likely to churn.
Subscription Length: Short-term subscribers have a higher churn rate.
